Process machines are designed to exceed customer expectations, reduce Work In Process (WIP), and increase throughput to expose capacity for increased warfighter support. In addition, process machines must be customer focused and directly aligned with customer requirements.

In its most basic sense, speed equals reduced flowtime. AoP creates a methodology that measures performance in a manner that focuses the organization on the weakest link in their processes. This focus leads to process improvement initiatives that affect the speed of throughput for the organizational process.

It is not about hurrying, or cutting corners, nor is speed obtained on the backs of the workforce. Speed must be achieved through improved processes, an enterprise focus, and a common agreement and understanding of the goal of speed. Speed must be mindful of safety and quality. The AFSC recognizes that speed without quality is not beneficial; therefore the focus on speed is about understanding the processes that fuel our execution, both on and above the shop floor, and improving those processes with the goal of making the\
  processes more expedient. AoP’s focus on efficiency serves to create speed while improving quality and safety – making quality and safety integral parts of the process.",

It is imperative that both professional leaders and the professional workforce understand their specific work center goals and roles in meeting performance targets. We would not expect everyone in\

Leaders can offer advice, provide direction, and share thought processes, but developing those around us involves letting others develop answers and the way forward.
